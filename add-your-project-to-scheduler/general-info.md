# General info

If you want to add your project to the scheduler, you have to add it to the biatec meta code first, and then the blockly designer.

Biatec meta code is json/yaml schema similar to pipeline execution scripts where each work item is converted into the tealscript code.

Frontend uses the blockly to create the biatec meta code which is rendered to the tealscript at the api and generated client is produced.
